# Data Processor

A standard data processor that I use for processing CSV files, and the like.

Already comes pre-packaged with:

* `rxjs` for stream-based processing
* `winston` for error logging
* `jaro-winkler` for string evaluation (edit distance)
* `prompts` for retrieving user input

Written in `typescript`

## Samples

Samples can be found in the `samples` folder.
